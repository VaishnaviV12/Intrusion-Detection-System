Basics of IDS /It's function /How it works 

INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM -

-An intrusion detection system (IDS) is like a security guard for computer networks. It's a special program or device that keeps an eye on all the information coming in and going out of a network. 
-Its job is to look for anything unusual or suspicious that might suggest someone is trying to break into the system.
-Think of it as a detective that knows the usual tricks that bad guys use to break into computers. 
-The IDS pays attention to the patterns of data moving through the network, and if it sees something that matches a known trick, it raises an alarm to let the system administrators know that there might be a security problem.
-Depending on where the IDS is placed, it can watch for suspicious stuff coming from outside the network (like from the internet) or from inside the network. 
-It's like having a security camera that keeps an eye on who's trying to get in or out of a building.

MAIN FUNCTION OF IDS 

-An IDS is like a computer detective that looks at what's happening inside a computer or a network to find anything that shouldn't be there. 
-It checks for things like someone trying to get in without permission or someone using the system in a way they're not supposed to.
-You can also think of an IDS as a "packet sniffer," which is like a spy that listens to the messages (packets) passing through the internet and other communication networks. 
-It captures these messages and then looks at them closely to see if anything seems suspicious or not right.
-Once the IDS notices something fishy, like someone trying to break into the system, it sets off an alarm to let the system owners know that there might be a problem. 
-So, it's basically a security guard for computers, keeping an eye out for any signs of trouble.

HOW IT WORKS

The main job of an IDS is to watch for and detect intrusions in real-time. Some IDS can also respond to and prevent these intrusions. Here's how it works:

- The IDS has sensors that keep an eye on data packets for any signs of bad activity. It looks for known patterns of malicious behavior, and some advanced systems can even detect unusual behavior that might indicate an attack.

- If the IDS finds a match with a known bad pattern, it does certain actions that were set up beforehand. This could include stopping the connection, blocking the IP address (like putting up a virtual barrier), ignoring or getting rid of the suspicious packet, and telling the system administrator with an alarm.

- If the known pattern is not found, the IDS might then check for any unusual traffic patterns, looking for things that don't seem normal or expected.

- Once the data packet passes all these tests and doesn't seem dangerous, the IDS lets it continue on its way through the network. So, it's like a security guard that not only spots trouble but can also take quick actions to stop it.

HOW AN IDS DETECTS AN INTRUSION 

1.Signature Recognition - Signature recognition, or misuse detection, is like a virtual watchdog that focuses on finding signs of improper use or abuse within a computer system or network. Its main job is to spot specific patterns or "signatures" that match known methods of misusing or attacking the system. When it detects such a signature, it raises an alert to signal that there might be an attempt to abuse or compromise the system's security. Essentially, it's a way of recognizing and responding to known tricks and tactics that hackers commonly use to exploit vulnerabilities.

2.Anomaly Detection - Detecting intrusions based on fixed behavioral characteristics means that the system is looking for deviations from normal or expected behavior. It establishes a baseline of what typical behavior looks like for users and components in a computer system.

Imagine if every user and component in a computer system has a usual or expected way of behaving. This could include typical patterns of accessing files, using applications, and interacting with the network. The intrusion detection system (IDS) observes and learns these behaviors over time.

When there is a deviation from these established behavioral patterns, the IDS recognizes it as potentially suspicious or indicative of an intrusion. This could be someone trying to access sensitive information in an unusual way or a component of the system behaving differently than it normally does. In such cases, the IDS triggers an alert to notify administrators that there might be an unauthorized or abnormal activity happening within the system. Essentially, it's like the system's way of saying, "This doesn't look normal based on what I've learned, so you might want to check it out."

3.Protocol Anomaly Detection - In this type of detection, models are created to identify anomalies or unusual behaviors in how vendors implement the TCP/IP specification. Essentially, it means studying how different companies or vendors use the rules and protocols of TCP/IP—the fundamental communication language of the internet.

TCP/IP governs how data is sent and received across networks, and different vendors may implement it in slightly different ways. An intrusion detection system (IDS) using this approach learns the normal or expected behavior associated with how specific vendors deploy TCP/IP.

When the IDS detects a deviation or anomaly in the way a particular vendor is using TCP/IP, it raises an alert. This could indicate a potential security threat or an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the network based on irregularities in how the TCP/IP protocols are being handled by a specific vendor's equipment or software.

GENERAL INDICATIONS OF INTRUSION

1.File System Intrusions - 
-The presence of new or unfamiliar files, or programs
-Changes in file permissions Unexplained changes in a file’s size
-Rogue files on the system that do not correspond to the master list of signed files
-Missing files

2.Network Intrusions
-Repeated probes of the available services on your machines
-Connections from unusual locations
-Repeated login attempts from remote hosts
-A sudden influx of log data

3.System Intrusions
-Short or incomplete logs 
-Unusually slow system performance 
-Missing logs or logs with incorrect permissions or ownership
-Modifications to system software and configuration files
-Unusual graphic displays or text messages 
-Gaps in system accounting System crashes or reboots 
-Unfamiliar processes

Types of Intrusion Detection Systems

1.Network-Based Intrusion Detection Systems -
-These systems usually have a device, often referred to as a "black box," which is placed on the network and operates in a promiscuous mode. This means the device actively listens to all network traffic, like a silent observer, without actively participating in the communication. Its purpose is to identify patterns that suggest a potential intrusion.

-The black box is designed to detect malicious activities such as Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, port scans (checking for open communication ports on a computer), and attempts to break into computers. It achieves this by closely monitoring the data flowing through the network. If it notices unusual patterns or signs that match known tactics used in attacks, it raises an alert to notify administrators. Essentially, it's like a security guard silently watching over network traffic, ready to sound the alarm if it sees anything suspicious.

2.Host-Based Intrusion Detection Systems -
-These systems typically involve checking and keeping records of events that happen on a specific computer. However, they are not very common because they can slow down the system by constantly monitoring every single event.

-In simpler terms, these systems are like digital record keepers for a specific computer. They pay close attention to everything that happens on that computer, logging each event. This could include someone logging in, files being accessed, or changes being made to the system.

-While they provide a detailed record of activities, the downside is that constantly keeping track of every event can make the computer work a bit more slowly. So, even though they offer thorough monitoring, they're not as widely used due to the extra load they put on the computer's resources.

TYPES OF IDS ALERTS

1.True Positive (Attack - Alert): The IDS correctly identifies and raises an alarm for a legitimate attack.
2.False Positive (No Attack - Alert): The IDS incorrectly identifies and raises an alarm for an activity that is not a real security threat.
3.False Negative (Attack - No Alert): An IDS does not raise an alarm when a legitimate attack has taken place.
4.True Negative (No Attack-No Alert): An IDS does not raise an alarm when an
