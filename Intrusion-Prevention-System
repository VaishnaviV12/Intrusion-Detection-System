INTRUSION PREVENTION SYSTEM

let's break it down in simpler terms:

Imagine your computer network is like a fortress, and you have guards (firewalls) at the entrance checking everyone who comes in. 
Now, an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is like a superhero guard inside your fortress.

1.Detecting and Preventing Trouble:
   - IPS is not just looking out for trouble; it can actually stop it. If it sees something fishy, it doesn't just raise an alarm; 
it takes action to block the bad stuff.

2.Always on Guard:
   - IPS is like a guard that never sleeps. It's always watching your network for any signs of trouble.
This is different from an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), which is like a security camera â€“ 
it can see what's happening but can't actively stop anything.

3.Extra Layer of Defense:
   - Think of your firewalls as the first line of defense at the entrance of your fortress. 
The IPS is an extra layer of protection inside, ready to tackle any threats that might have slipped past the first line.

4.Inline Superhero:
   - While an IDS watches from the sidelines, an IPS is right in the middle of the action. 
It stands between the source (where the threat is coming from) and the destination (your network) and actively checks everything that tries to get in.

5.Quick Decision Maker:
   - The IPS doesn't waste time. It quickly analyzes the network traffic, and if it sees something bad, 
it makes decisions on the spot. It's like a superhero making split-second decisions to keep your fortress safe.

In a nutshell, an IPS is like a proactive, always-alert guard inside your network that not only spots trouble but also jumps into action 
to stop it before it causes harm.

let's break down the classification of IPS and its advantages in simpler terms:

Types of IPS:

1.Host-based IPS:
   - Think of this like a bodyguard for each computer or device. It watches over individual machines, 
checking if there's any trouble happening right there on the device.

2.Network-based IPS:
   - This one is like a superhero guard for the entire network. It stands in the middle of the network, 
keeping an eye on all the incoming and outgoing traffic to make sure everything is safe.

Advantages of IPS over IDS:

1.Block and Drop Bad Stuff:
   - IPS doesn't just tell you when there's a problem; it actively stops it. If it sees something harmful, 
it doesn't just raise an alarm, it blocks and drops the bad packets so they can't cause any harm.

2.Keep an Eye on Your Organization:
   - Unlike IDS, which might be more like a distant observer, IPS is right there in your organization, monitoring everything. 
It's like having a security guard patrolling inside your building rather than just watching from outside.

3.Stop Attacks Before They Happen:
   - IPS doesn't wait for an attack to happen and then react; it's proactive. By controlling the amount of traffic coming in, 
it can prevent direct attacks from occurring in the first place. It's like locking the doors to your fortress to keep the bad guys out.

In simple terms, IPS is like having personal bodyguards for each device and a superhero guard for your entire network. 
It actively stops bad things from happening, keeps a close eye on what's going on inside your organization, and takes steps to prevent 
attacks before they even start.
